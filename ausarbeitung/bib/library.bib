abstract = {This study presents the first evaluation of apple flowering phenology models using data from 14 sites across the globe. The dataset includes large variability in growing climates, a prerequisite to investigate phenology models for use in climate change applications. Two flowering stages, early and full, were investigated allowing for unique model evaluation based on both statistical performance and biological assumptions. Two overarching phenology models (Sequential and Chill Overlap) and two sub-models of chill (Dynamic and Triangular) and heat (GDH and Sigmoidal) were tested. Flowering times from the different sites illustrated the differing effects of contrasting winter and spring temperatures. Sites with similar springtime temperatures, but different winter temperatures, had different flowering patterns (warmer winter sites flowered later). Across all analyses, results from the Chill Overlap model were better than those from the Sequential model. Of the Chill Overlap models, those fitted with the Triangular or Dynamic chill model and the GDH heat sub-model performed well statistically and met the assumptions of the model across both flowering stages. The mild sites in the analysis were least well represented, regardless of model selection. This global evaluation demonstrated that flowering modelling in temperate fruit trees would progress through appropriate choices of overarching model, sub-models and parameters.},

abstract = {This paper examines the impacts of declining winter chill on the production of temperate perennial crops in the northern hemisphere. Recent studies have linked long-term climate data to key seasonal reproductive events in perennial plants. These studies suggest that the amount of winter chill occurring in the UK has declined and is predicted to continue to do so, based on future climate change scenarios described in the UK Climate Impacts Programme. It is apparent that there is a serious lack of mechanistic understanding of the physiological, molecular and genetical basis of winter chill requirement and dormancy-related environmental factors which affect perennial crop growth and yield. This situation exists despite knowledge of the impacts of climate on perennial plant development and an ability to model its effects, for many temperate fruit crops, on yield. The implications for future reductions in winter chill require recognition as a potential limiting factor on fruit production across Europe, particularly in the south. Within this review we describe the symptoms of lack of winter chill; these include effects on bud break, flower quality and the potential to set fruit, as well as effects on vegetative growth and development. Also included is current knowledge of developmental and physiological events which link flower initiation, anthesis, dormancy, chilling and bud break. Attention is given to what is known about dormancy induction, satisfaction of specific requirements and bud break. Possible strategies are described for mitigation of reduced winter chill, providing long-term solutions to secure perennial fruit supplies in Europe. This includes exploiting genotypic variability, within several perennial crops, through plant breeding to develop low chill-cultivars, together with opportunities to change crop management practices and growing systems to tolerate low chill. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A theoretical study proves that the common Spring-Warming model, which is widely used in phenological studies and frequently described in the literature, has systematic defects that do not allow a reliable projection of phenological stages for the future (e.g., up to 2100). When calculating spring phenological phases (e.g., beginning of blossom or leaf unfolding, etc.), defects occur because either the advance in blossom is included implicitly in the model and cannot be calibrated sufficiently to observations, or the model parameters attain unphysiological values or lie in a range so that a prognosis for the far future cannot be accomplished. Therefore, the introduction of a daylength term is suggested, which improves the Spring-Warming model and eliminates almost all of the discussed shortcomings. The performance of this improved model is demonstrated by calculating the beginning of apple blossom in Germany. For this purpose, we compared the improved model (M1) with three different versions of the original Spring-Warming model (M2-M4). The models were calibrated (optimized) using observed blossoming and temperature data (1962-2009), which have been regionalized on a 0.2° grid. The optimization was done for a representative grid point. The performance of the various model versions in predicting the beginning of apple blossom was compared with observations from independent years, which were not used in the optimization. Also, the beginning of blossom and its possible future changes were calculated with these models, using temperatures from the Regional Climate Model REMO-UBA with GHG emission scenario A1B (2001-2100). The new daylength term improved the performance of model M1 remarkably, and the model calibration automatically led to model parameters with meaningful values. These results, which were confirmed by other fruit tree species and locations, provided strong evidence that the conventional Spring-Warming models in phenology must be extended by photoperiodic sensitivity, at least for species which are photosensitive. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In Germany phenological phases of the natural vegetation as well as of fruit trees and field crops have advanced clearly in the last decade of the 20th century. The strongest shift in plant development occurred for the very early spring phases. The late spring phases and summer phases reacted also to the increased temperatures, but they usually show lower trends. Until now the changes in plant development are still moderate, so that no strong impacts on yield formation processes were observed. But further climate changes will probably increase the effect on plants, so that in the future stronger impacts on crop yields are likely. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Statistical downscaling of general circulation models (GCMs) and limited area models (LAMs) has been promoted as a method for simulating regional- to point-scale precipitation under changed climate conditions. However, several studies have shown that downscaled precipitation is either insensitive to changes in climatic forcing, or inconsistent with the broad-scale changes indicated by the host GCM(s). This has been recently attributed to the omission of the effect that changes in atmospheric moisture content have on precipitation. We describe validation of a nonhomogeneous hid- den Markov model (NHMM) for changed climate conditions and apply it to a network of 30 daily pre- cipitation stations in southwestern Australia. NHMMs fitted to 1 × CO2 LAM data were validated by assessing their performance in predicting 2 × CO2 LAM precipitation. The inclusion of 850 hPa dew point temperature depression, a predictor reflecting relative (rather than absolute) atmospheric mois- ture content, was found to be crucial to successful performance of the NHMM under 2 × CO2 condi- tions. The NHMM validated for the LAM data was fitted to the historical 30 station network and then used to downscale the 2 × CO2 LAM atmospheric data, producing plausible predictions of station pre- cipitation under 2 × CO2 conditions. Our results highlight that the validation of a statistical downscal- ing technique for present day conditions does not necessarily imply legitimacy for changed climate conditions. Thus statistical downscaling studies that have not attempted to determine the plausibility of their predictions for the changed climate conditions should be viewed with caution.},

abstract = {A two-step model describing the thermal dependence of the dormancy breaking phenomenon is developed. The model assumes that the level of dormancy completion is proportional to the amount of a certain dormancy breaking factor which accumulates in plants by a two-step process. The first step represents a reversible process of formation of a precursor for the dormancy breaking factor at low temperatures and its destruction at high temperatures. The rate constants of this process are assumed to be dependent upon the temperature according to the Arrhenius law. The second step is an irreversible cooperative transition from the unstable precursor to a stable dormancy breaking factor. The transition is assumed to occur when a critical level of the precursor is accumulated. The two-step scheme is analysed mathematically. This model explains qualitatively the main observations on dormancy completion made under controlled temperature conditions and relates the parameters of the theory to the measurable characteristics of the system.},

abstract = {Temperate fruit and nut species require exposure to chilling conditions in winter to break dormancy and produce high yields. Adequate winter chill is an important site characteristic for commercial orchard operations, and quantifying chill is crucial for orchard management. Climate change may impact winter chill. With a view to adapting orchards to climate change, this review assesses the state of knowledge in modelling winter chill and the performance of various modelling approaches. It then goes on to present assessments of past and projected future changes in winter chill for fruit growing regions and discusses potential adaptation strategies. Some of the most common approaches to modelling chill, in particular the Chilling Hours approach, are very sensitive to temperature increases, and have also been found to perform poorly, especially in warm growing regions. The Dynamic Model offers a more complex but also more accurate alternative, and use of this model is recommended. Chill changes projected with the Dynamic Model are typically much less severe than those estimated with other models. Nevertheless, projections of future chill consistently indicate substantial losses for the warmest growing regions, while temperate regions will experience relatively little change, and cold regions may even see chill increases. Growers can adapt to lower chill by introducing low-chill cultivars, by influencing orchard microclimates and by applying rest-breaking chemicals. Given substantial knowledge gaps in tree dormancy, accurate models are still a long way off. Since timely adaptation is essential for growers of long-lived high-value perennials, alternative ways of adaptation planning are needed. Climate analogues, which are present-day manifestations of future projected climates, can be used for identifying and testing future-adapted species and cultivars. Horticultural researchers and practitioners should work towards the development and widespread adoption of better chill accumulation and dormancy models, for facilitating quantitatively appropriate adaptation planning. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Seven different model approaches to calculate the onset of sour cherry blossom for the main growing regions in Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany) were compared. Three of the approaches were pure forcing models (M1, M2, M2DL) and the remaining four models were combined sequential chilling-forcing (CF) models. Model M1 was the commonly used growing degree day (GDD) model in which the starting date of temperature accumulation (t 1), the base temperature (T BF) and the forcing requirement F* were optimized on the basis of observed data. Because of a relatively late optimal starting date (t 1 = 1 March), the model can be applied only to calculate the onset of cherry blossom for present climate conditions. In order to develop forcing models that could possibly be used to estimate possible shifts in the timing of cherry blossom due to climate change, the starting date t 1 of the models was intentionally set to 1 January (M2, M2DL). Unfortunately, model M2 failed in both the optimization and validation period. The introduction of a daylength term (DL) in model M2DL improved model performance. In order to project possible shifts in the timing of plant phenological events, combined CF-models are preferred over pure GDD-models. For this reason four CF-models were developed with (M3DL, M4DL) and without (M3, M4) consideration of daylength in the GDD-approach. The chilling requirement was calculated using chilling hours (M3, M3DL) and chill portions (M4, M4DL). Both models without daylength estimated implausible model parameters and failed model validation. However, models M3DL and M4DL showed meaningful model parameter estimations and the error between modelled and observed data was markedly reduced. Moreover, the models optimized and validated (internal validation) for one sour cherry growing region in Germany, were applied successfully to calculate the beginning of the blossom period in other regions in Europe and even at one station in North America (external validation).},

abstract = {Tardive frosts, i.e. frost events occurring after grapevine budburst, are a significant risk for viticultural practices, which have recently caused substantial yield losses over different winegrowing regions of France, e.g. in 2016 and 2017. So far, it is unclear whether the frequency of late frosts events is destined to increase or decrease under future climatic conditions. Here, we assess the risk of tardive frosts for the French vineyards throughout the 21st century by analyzing temperature projections from eight climate models and their statistical regional downscaling. Our approach consists in comparing the statistical occurrences of the last frost (day of the year) and the characteristic budburst date for nine grapevine varieties as simulated by three different phenological models. Climate models qualitatively agree in projecting a gradual increase in temperature all over the France, which generally produces both an earlier characteristic last frost day and an earlier characteristic budburst date. However, the latter notably depends on the specific phenological model, implying a large uncertainty in assessing the risk exposure. Overall, we identified Alsace, Burgundy and Champagne as the most vulnerable regions, where the probability of tardive frost is projected to significantly increase throughout the 21st century for two out of three phenological models. The third phenological model produces opposite results, but the comparison between simulated budburst dates and observed records over the last 60 years suggests its lower reliability. Nevertheless, for a more trustworthy risk assessment, the validity of the budburst models should be accurately tested also for warmer climate conditions, in order to narrow down the associated large uncertainty.},

abstract = {A theoretical study proves that the common Spring-Warming model, which is widely used in phenological studies and frequently described in the literature, has systematic defects that do not allow a reliable projection of phenological stages for the future (e.g., up to 2100). When calculating spring phenological phases (e.g., beginning of blossom or leaf unfolding, etc.), defects occur because either the advance in blossom is included implicitly in the model and cannot be calibrated sufficiently to observations, or the model parameters attain unphysiological values or lie in a range so that a prognosis for the far future cannot be accomplished. Therefore, the introduction of a daylength term is suggested, which improves the Spring-Warming model and eliminates almost all of the discussed shortcomings. The performance of this improved model is demonstrated by calculating the beginning of apple blossom in Germany. For this purpose, we compared the improved model (M1) with three different versions of the original Spring-Warming model (M2-M4). The models were calibrated (optimized) using observed blossoming and temperature data (1962-2009), which have been regionalized on a 0.2° grid. The optimization was done for a representative grid point. The performance of the various model versions in predicting the beginning of apple blossom was compared with observations from independent years, which were not used in the optimization. Also, the beginning of blossom and its possible future changes were calculated with these models, using temperatures from the Regional Climate Model REMO-UBA with GHG emission scenario A1B (2001-2100). The new daylength term improved the performance of model M1 remarkably, and the model calibration automatically led to model parameters with meaningful values. These results, which were confirmed by other fruit tree species and locations, provided strong evidence that the conventional Spring-Warming models in phenology must be extended by photoperiodic sensitivity, at least for species which are photosensitive. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Modeling studies predict that global warming might severely affect bud dormancy release. However, growing empirical evidences suggest that long photoperiod might compensate for a lack of chilling temperature in photosensitive species. For now, attempts to integrate this effect into models remain limited. Here, we used French budburst phenological records for two main European temperate tree species, Fagus sylvatica (n = 136) and Quercus petraea (n = 276), to compare four phenological models accounting for a photoperiod effect, two of them proposing a new formalism of the effect of photoperiod, and three classical thermal models. We also investigated the effect of a realistic photoperiod cue on budburst dates in future climatic conditions. Consistently with the empirical literature, we find that models integrating a photoperiod cue were more relevant to simulate budburst dates for beech than for oak. However, contrary to the recently debated expectation that photoperiod might mitigate the trend towards earlier budburst date, we find that the compensatory effect of photoperiod on a lack of chilling maintains a trend towards earlier dates up to the end of the 2100. Our results also suggest that phenological rank changes between photosensitive and photo-insensitive species may be more pronounced at cold than warm trailing edge.},

This is the first study to directly compare the chill overlap and sequential phenology models and the first flowering phenology study of this spatial size for apple in the Southern Hemisphere. The sequential model did not adequately explain the variability in the dataset (RMSE 14.7 days) and was a worse approach than modelling to mean full bloom day-of-year (RMSE 9.6 days). The chill overlap model fitted with a chilling requirement of 34 chill portions was better able to represent the observations with RMSE of 6.9 and 5.8 days for parameterising and validating datasets, respectively. Based on the results of this study, further exploration and application of the chill overlap model is warranted, particularly in relation to climate impact assessments and for the development of adaptation strategies.},

In parallel, in 3 seasons (2011/2012-2013/2014) climate chamber experiments were performed in order to determine the end of dormancy for 'Summit', which is usually an unknown or uncertain parameter in phenological modelling. Additionally, in the season 2013/2014 an in situ climate change experiment on three trees in the sweet cherry orchard were arranged, which was used to validate the phenological models for distinctly warmer climate conditions at the experimental site. On the basis of our climate chamber experiments we quantified the chilling requirement of 'Summit' trees. Thus, we were able to identify a CF-model for the beginning of sweet cherry blossom which is mostly physiologically based and works well for current and for future climate conditions at the experimental site. This paper also shows how phenological models can fail under warmer climates, if either the model is too simple or the model parameters are wrong. Additional, we confirmed that phenological models with DL-term in the forcing approach clearly surpassed the conventional phenological models without this parameter. The reason for this behaviour is extensively discussed.},

The late spring phases and summer phases reacted also to the increased temperatures, but they usually show lower trends. Until now the changes in plant development are still moderate, so that no strong impacts on yield formation processes were observed. But further climate changes will probably increase the effect on plants, so that in the future stronger impacts on crop yields are likely. {\textcopyright}2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Six phenological models, two simple forcing (F)-models and one sequential chilling/forcing (CF)-model, each with and without day length (DL)-term in the forcing approach were optimised (2001-2010) and validated (2011-2015) on very accurate blossoming data of an experimental sweet cherry orchard at Berlin-Dahlem (cultivar 'Summit'). In parallel, in 3 seasons (2011/2012-2013/2014) climate chamber experiments were performed in order to determine the end of dormancy for 'Summit', which is usually an unknown or uncertain parameter in phenological modelling. Additionally, in the season 2013/2014 an in situ climate change experiment on three trees in the sweet cherry orchard were arranged, which was used to validate the phenological models for distinctly warmer climate conditions at the experimental site. On the basis of our climate chamber experiments we quantified the chilling requirement of 'Summit' trees. Thus, we were able to identify a CF-model for the beginning of sweet cherry blossom which is mostly physiologically based and works well for current and for future climate conditions at the experimental site. This paper also shows how phenological models can fail under warmer climates, if either the model is too simple or the model parameters are wrong. Additional, we confirmed that phenological models with DL-term in the forcing approach clearly surpassed the conventional phenological models without this parameter. The reason for this behaviour is extensively discussed.},

abstract = {Inter-annual variation in climate is reflected by changes in the timing of phenology. Over the last decades a considerable number of models have been developed in order to explain the inter-annual variation of spring phenology in trees. Contrary to empirical models, “process-based” models aim at simulating physiological processes in order to yield more realistic predictions of growing season onset dates. Despite the increasing knowledge on the environmental controls of seasonal dormancy in trees, the detailed action and interaction of the involved environmental drivers (chilling, photoperiod and warm temperature) remains to be elucidated. This study aims at a uniform comparison of a wide range of existing models (and new recombinations), on a multitude of long-term observation series in six tree species across central Europe, using extensive cross-validation. Even though the assessed models differ in the phases of dormancy and environmental drivers accounted for, they yielded a surprisingly similar quality of prediction of leaf unfolding dates. Depending on the species, the lowest average prediction errors for leaf unfolding (RMSE) ranged from 7 to 9 days for the dataset pooled across sites and years and from 4 to 6 days for site-specific predictions, in absence of any obvious geographical pattern. Simple models, that feature ecodormancy release only, performed similar or better than more complex models, which additionally include endodormancy release through chilling temperatures. Model parameterisation tended to converge towards similar behaviour and models with many parameters tended to overfit on the 40 year time-series of leaf unfolding. Additionally, all models tended to underestimate the inter-annual variation of leaf unfolding and failed to predict very early or late dates of leaf unfolding in certain years. The transfer of site-specific parameters to other sites was associated with an almost doubling of the average prediction error, independent of distance and climatic similarity between the calibration and validation sites. The findings challenge the accurate implementation of the physiological processes controlling spring phenology in the models and highlight shortcomings associated with model parameterisation on observational time-series only.},

abstract = {Chilling temperatures are important in apple and other fruit production because they are needed to break full dormancy, which is a prerequisite for effective and synchronous bud-break and flowering. Temperature increase related to climate change could lead to inadequate chilling in certain areas, which could affect the suitability for some species or cultivars to survive or yield in that location. The aim of this study was to estimate how climate change could affect flowering date and, consequently, feasibility of the most significant apple cultivars in the lower Fluvi{\`{a}} subbasin (correspondent to the Protected Geographical Indication "Poma de Girona"). The estimations are based on a chilling and forcing requirements approach for each apple cultivar in this region, through a statistical analysis. The chilling-forcing sequential model, together with meteorological projections based on two climate change scenarios (B1 and A2), were used to estimate apple flowering dates along the 21st Century. Results show, in general, that apple cultivars could suffer delays on flowering date since the mid century and they could present serious disorders as a consequence of insufficient chilling in the long term in A2 scenario, which could affect crop feasibility in the region.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Four different chilling models, the Weinberger-Eggert model (C1), Utah model (C2), Positive Utah model (C3), and Dynamic model (C4), were used to evaluate possible future changes in the date of dormancy release (t₁) in Germany for deciduous fruit crops with a chilling requirement (C*) ranging from 700 to 1800 chill units. The study was based on gridded air temperature data in a 7 × 11 km horizontal resolution for current and future climate conditions. Currently, dormancy of low chill crops, up to {\~{}}1000 chill units, is released evenly across Germany. However, for high chill cultivars (1500 to 1800 chill units) the chilling fulfillment occurs later in the colder continental, SE areas than in the mild, maritime NW regions of Germany. For future climate conditions (2071 to 2100), the patterns of t₁ will change, depending on the regional temperature rise. As a result, the areas which currently have a late date of dormancy release could have an advanced date in the future and vice versa, reducing the current differences between the northern and southern areas. Among the models, we found some different results. Model C1 showed a delay of t₁ for all values of C*. The other chilling models (C2–C4), showed a delay in t1 for low chill varieties (700 to 1000 chill units), only small changes for medium chill varieties (1100 to 1400 chill units), and an earlier timing in the end of winter dormancy for fruit crops with a high C* (1500 to 1800 chill units). If we follow the results of these 3 models, we conclude that dormancy in a wide range of deciduous fruit crops in Germany will be released early enough to ensure a timely start of reproductive development in the future.},

A complete picture of dormancy is shown in this review, using results from the early, pioneering work to the molecular basis, also emphasising dormancy modelling and measurement and their implication in temperate fruit production. This description is completed by the variability that climatic change might induce in plants through direct or indirect changes in dormancy. Future avenues for the correct adaptation of temperate fruit crops are proposed that span basic questions, from temperate fruit distribution to more-applied questions of dormancy, such as application of rest-breaking agents, depth-of-dormancy markers, breeding strategies, cross-pollination and host-pest interaction.

The dataset includes large variability in growing climates, a prerequisite to investigate phenology models for use in climate change applications. Two flowering stages, early and full, were investigated allowing for unique model evaluation based on both statistical performance and biological assumptions. Two overarching phenology models (Sequential and Chill Overlap) and two sub-models of chill (Dynamic and Triangular) and heat (GDH and Sigmoidal) were tested. Flowering times from the different sites illustrated the differing effects of contrasting winter and spring temperatures. Sites with similar springtime temperatures, but different winter temperatures, had different flowering patterns (warmer winter sites flowered later). Across all analyses, results from the Chill Overlap model were better than those from the Sequential model. Of the Chill Overlap models, those fitted with the Triangular or Dynamic chill model and the GDH heat sub-model performed well statistically and met the assumptions of the model across both flowering stages. The mild sites in the analysis were least well represented, regardless of model selection. This global evaluation demonstrated that flowering modelling in temperate fruit trees would progress through appropriate choices of overarching model, sub-models and parameters.},

abstract = {Winters and early springs are predicted to become warmer in temperate climates under continued global warming, which in turn is expected to promote earlier plant development. By contrast, there is no consensus about the changes in the occurrence and severity of late spring frosts. If the frequency and severity of late spring frosts remain unchanged in the future or change less than spring phenology of plants does, vulnerable plant organs (dehardened buds, young leaves, flowers or young fruits) may be more exposed to frost damage. Here we analyzed long-term temperature data from the period 1975–2016 in 50 locations in Switzerland and used different phenological models calibrated with long-term series of the flowering and leaf-out timing of two fruit trees (apple and cherry) and two forest trees (Norway spruce and European beech) to test whether the risk of frost damage has increased during this period. Overall, despite the substantial increase in temperature during the study period, the risk of frost damage was not reduced because spring phenology has advanced at a faster rate than the date of the last spring frost. In contrast, we found that the risk of frost exposure and subsequent potential damage has increased for all four species at the vast majority of stations located at elevations higher than 800 m while remaining unchanged at lower elevations. The different trends between lower and higher elevations are due to the date of the last spring frost moving less at higher altitudes than at lower altitudes, combined with stronger phenological shifts at higher elevations. This latter trend likely results from a stronger warming during late compared to earlier spring and from the increasing role of other limiting factors at lower elevations (chilling and photoperiod). Our results suggest that frost risk needs to be considered carefully when promoting the introduction of new varieties of fruit trees or exotic forest tree species adapted to warmer and drier climates or when considering new plantations at higher elevations.},

abstract = {This study aimed to improve the modelling of flowering time in fruit trees and to understand to what extent global warming has affected this trait since the end of the 1980s,. The onset of flowering time (F1 stage) in apple trees has advanced by 7-8 d in France since the late 1980s. In this context, a sequential model composed of a chilling sub-model and a heat sub-model was considered. The input data consisted of F1 dates for 'Golden Delicious' apple in three French cropping areas from the North-West to South-East over the period 197.6 - 2002 (81 F1 dates). A user-oriented software package, called 'Pollenoscope', automatically optimised combinations between seven chilling and three heat temperature functions. This was achieved by maximizing the R-2 values between the observed and simulated flowering dates. The study provided comparative information for assessing the respective effects of temperature functions commonly used for modelling flowering time in temperate trees. Three selected models explained 82 - 86{\%} of the observed variability in flowering. Their fitness for an accurate prediction of the F1 date was validated using independent flowering datasets. All three models simulated similar time-course changes in the duration of the chilling effect at all three locations [i.e., a mean increase in the duration of this effect (by 3 - 5 d) since the end of the 1980s]. Consequently, it suggested that the duration of the heat effect had decreased (10 - 13 d) to explain the advance in flowering time. Hence, our results support the idea that global warming has, simultaneously, exerted two opposing effects in France between 1976 - 2002: (i) a slower mean rate of completion for the chilling requirement, and (ii) a higher mean rate of completion for the heat requirement. A more marked effect on completion of the heat requirement may have resulted from more pronounced warming from January to April, corresponding to the active growth phase of floral primordia, than from October to January, corresponding to the dormancy-breaking phase.},

abstract = {The aim of this research was to predict the changes in vine phenology of some white grape varieties when rainfed vineyards are subjected to climate change. The research was conducted in the north east of Spain, in an area with a Mediterranean climate. Temperature and precipitation changes under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios – RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 – were simulated based on an ensemble of models. Water losses by runoff were predicted using the WEPP model and changes in evapotranspiration were estimated according to the predicted changes in temperature, wind speed and solar radiation for the same scenarios. Dates of budbreak, bloom, veraison and harvest of three varieties were evaluated: Chardonnay, during the period 1998–2012; and Parellada and Macabeo during the period 1998–2009. Projections for 2030, 2050 and 2070 were made based on the observed phenological dates and the heat accumulation needed to reach each stage and water available recorded in different periods along the growing cycle. An advance of all phenological dates was predicted, higher for veraison and harvest than for the earlier stages and higher for Parellada than for Macabeo and Chardonnay. These stages may advance up to 10 and 16 days, respectively, for 2050 and up to 12 and 20 days for 2070 under the RCP4.5 scenario. Under RCP8.5 scenario, the advance by 2070 could be up to 23 and 28 days. These changes resulted in a shortening of the periods between phenological dates ({\textgreater}10 days), higher for Parellada than for Chardonnay and Macabeo. The results also showed an additional advance of bloom for Chardonnay and Macabeo associated with decreasing water available, and an advance of veraison and harvest for all three varieties, associated with decreasing water available, particularly between budbreak and bloom and between bloom and veraison, depending on the variety.},

abstract = {The effect of climatic warming on the timing of bud burst and the subsequent risk of frost damage on trees in central Finland was assessed with the aid of a computer model, 73 years of temperature data and a climatic scenario corresponding to doubled level of atmospheric CO2. In general, climatic warming has- tened bud burst, due to ontogenetic development during warm spells in autumn, winter and spring. During the years with the warmest winters in the scenario con- ditions: (a) bud burst took place during mid-winter; and (2) depending on the year, the trees were subsequently exposed to temperatures between -27 and -10°C. This finding suggests that the risk of frost damage to trees will be increased if the predicted climatic warming occurs. Because of the assumptions used in the model, the results are not conclusive, but they do point out the importance of further experimental studies on genetic and environmental regulation of timing of bud burst in trees.},

Temperature increase related to climate change could lead to inadequate chilling in certain areas, which could affect the suitability for some species or cultivars to survive or yield in that location. The aim of this study was to estimate how climate change could affect flowering date and, consequently, feasibility of the most significant apple cultivars in the lower Fluvi{\`{a}} subbasin (correspondent to the Protected Geographical Indication "Poma de Girona"). The estimations are based on a chilling and forcing requirements approach for each apple cultivar in this region, through a statistical analysis. The chilling-forcing sequential model, together with meteorological projections based on two climate change scenarios (B1 and A2), were used to estimate apple flowering dates along the 21st Century. Results show, in general, that apple cultivars could suffer delays on flowering date since the mid century and they could present serious disorders as a consequence of insufficient chilling in the long term in A2 scenario, which could affect crop feasibility in the region.},

Here an evaluation of the ERA-Interim-driven EURO-CORDEX regional climate model (RCM) ensemble is presented. The study documents the per-formance of the individual models in representing the basic spatiotemporal patterns of the European climate for the pe-riod 1989–2008. Model evaluation focuses on near-surface air temperature and precipitation, and uses the E-OBS data set as observational reference. The ensemble consists of 17 simulations carried out by seven different models at grid resolutions of 12 km (nine experiments) and 50 km (eight experiments). Several performance metrics computed from monthly and seasonal mean values are used to assess model performance over eight subdomains of the European conti-nent. Results are compared to those for the ERA40-driven ENSEMBLES simulations. The analysis confirms the ability of RCMs to capture the basic features of the European climate, including its vari-ability in space and time. But it also identifies nonnegligible deficiencies of the simulations for selected metrics, regions and seasons. Seasonally and regionally averaged tempera-ture biases are mostly smaller than 1.5 • C, while precipita-tion biases are typically located in the ±40 {\%} range. Some bias characteristics, such as a predominant cold and wet bias in most seasons and over most parts of Europe and a warm and dry summer bias over southern and southeastern Europe reflect common model biases. For seasonal mean quantities averaged over large European subdomains, no clear bene-fit of an increased spatial resolution (12 vs. 50 km) can be identified. The bias ranges of the EURO-CORDEX ensem-ble mostly correspond to those of the ENSEMBLES simula-tions, but some improvements in model performance can be identified (e.g., a less pronounced southern European warm summer bias). The temperature bias spread across different Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 1298 S.

abstract = {This study seeks to highlight the range of chilling requirement values that can be obtained for one cherry cultivar (‘Lapins') across different Australian locations by using the same data but different approaches in calculating chilling requirement (CR). We seek to test the assumption that chill thresholds are fixed. The physiological and in-field implications for management are explored. All sites and years showed a steady increase in chill accumulation during the year. Bud burst in relation to accumulated chill portions (CP) was not consistent between sites or years, but all sites exhibited a sharp increase in bud burst after 40 chill portions (CP). Using a 50{\%} bud burst threshold performed statistically better than a 30{\%} bud burst threshold, and observed CR values performed slightly better than modelled CR values. The spatial analyses of safe winter chill for the range of CR determined in this study confirm the variability in values between the 30{\%} and 50{\%} bud burst approach. Imposing a fixed start date for chill accumulation excluded varying amounts of chill compared with using the self-regulating start time and increased the variation of CR values. The implications of using different methods to estimate CR, using projected estimates of chill accumulation under climate change, are provided. This study has e xposed the complexity in not only comparing CR values from previous studies, but the inherent confusion in the communication of such knowledge, especially with the additional consideration of a warming climate.},

abstract = {Temperate fruit and nut species require exposure to chilling conditions in winter to break dormancy and produce high yields. Adequate winter chill is an important site characteristic for commercial orchard operations, and quantifying chill is crucial for orchard management. Climate change may impact winter chill. With a view to adapting orchards to climate change, this review assesses the state of knowledge in modelling winter chill and the performance of various modelling approaches. It then goes on to present assessments of past and projected future changes in winter chill for fruit growing regions and discusses potential adaptation strategies. Some of the most common approaches to modelling chill, in particular the Chilling Hours approach, are very sensitive to temperature increases, and have also been found to perform poorly, especially in warm growing regions. The Dynamic Model offers a more complex but also more accurate alternative, and use of this model is recommended. Chill changes projected with the Dynamic Model are typically much less severe than those estimated with other models. Nevertheless, projections of future chill consistently indicate substantial losses for the warmest growing regions, while temperate regions will experience relatively little change, and cold regions may even see chill increases. Growers can adapt to lower chill by introducing low-chill cultivars, by influencing orchard microclimates and by applying rest-breaking chemicals. Given substantial knowledge gaps in tree dormancy, accurate models are still a long way off. Since timely adaptation is essential for growers of long-lived high-value perennials, alternative ways of adaptation planning are needed. Climate analogues, which are present-day manifestations of future projected climates, can be used for identifying and testing future-adapted species and cultivars. Horticultural researchers and practitioners should work towards the development and widespread adoption of better chill accumulation and dormancy models, for facilitating quantitatively appropriate adaptation planning. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The responses of flowering phenology to temperature increases in temperate fruit trees have rarely been investigated in contrasting climatic regions. This is an appropriate framework for highlighting varying responses to diverse warming contexts, which would potentially combine chill accumulation declines and heat accumulation increases. To examine this issue, a data set was constituted in apple tree from flowering dates collected for two phenological stages of three cultivars in seven climate-contrasting temperate regions of Western Europe and in three mild regions, one in Northern Morocco and two in Southern Brazil. Multiple change-point models were applied to flowering date series, as well as to corresponding series of mean temperature during two successive periods, respectively determining for the fulfillment of chill and heat requirements. A new overview in space and time of flowering date changes was provided in apple tree highlighting not only flowering date advances as in previous studies but also stationary flowering date series. At global scale, differentiated flowering time patterns result from varying interactions between contrasting thermal determinisms of flowering dates and contrasting warming contexts. This may explain flowering date advances in most of European regions and in Morocco vs. stationary flowering date series in the Brazilian regions. A notable exception in Europe was found in the French Mediterranean region where the flowering date series was stationary. While the flowering duration series were stationary whatever the region, the flowering durations were far longer in mild regions compared to temperate regions. Our findings suggest a new warming vulnerability in temperate Mediterranean regions, which could shift towards responding more to chill decline and consequently experience late and extended flowering under future warming scenarios.},

The research was conducted in the north east of Spain, in an area with a Mediterranean climate. Temperature and precipitation changes under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios – RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 – were simulated based on an ensemble of models. Water losses by runoff were predicted using the WEPP model and changes in evapotranspiration were estimated according to the predicted changes in temperature, wind speed and solar radiation for the same scenarios. Dates of budbreak, bloom, veraison and harvest of three varieties were evaluated: Chardonnay, during the period 1998–2012; and Parellada and Macabeo during the period 1998–2009. Projections for 2030, 2050 and 2070 were made based on the observed phenological dates and the heat accumulation needed to reach each stage and water available recorded in different periods along the growing cycle. An advance of all phenological dates was predicted, higher for veraison and harvest than for the earlier stages and higher for Parellada than for Macabeo and Chardonnay. These stages may advance up to 10 and 16 days, respectively, for 2050 and up to 12 and 20 days for 2070 under the RCP4.5 scenario. Under RCP8.5 scenario, the advance by 2070 could be up to 23 and 28 days. These changes resulted in a shortening of the periods between phenological dates ({\textgreater}10 days), higher for Parellada than for Chardonnay and Macabeo.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Winters and early springs are predicted to become warmer in temperate climates under continued global warming, which in turn is expected to promote earlier plant development. By contrast, there is no consensus about the changes in the occurrence and severity of late spring frosts. If the frequency and severity of late spring frosts remain unchanged in the future or change less than spring phenology of plants does, vulnerable plant organs (dehardened buds, young leaves, flowers or young fruits) may be more exposed to frost damage. Here we analyzed long-term temperature data from the period 1975–2016 in 50 locations in Switzerland and used different phenological models calibrated with long-term series of the flowering and leaf-out timing of two fruit trees (apple and cherry) and two forest trees (Norway spruce and European beech) to test whether the risk of frost damage has increased during this period. Overall, despite the substantial increase in temperature during the study period, the risk of frost damage was not reduced because spring phenology has advanced at a faster rate than the date of the last spring frost. In contrast, we found that the risk of frost exposure and subsequent potential damage has increased for all four species at the vast majority of stations located at elevations higher than 800 m while remaining unchanged at lower elevations. The different trends between lower and higher elevations are due to the date of the last spring frost moving less at higher altitudes than at lower altitudes, combined with stronger phenological shifts at higher elevations. This latter trend likely results from a stronger warming during late compared to earlier spring and from the increasing role of other limiting factors at lower elevations (chilling and photoperiod). Our results suggest that frost risk needs to be considered carefully when promoting the introduction of new varieties of fruit trees or exotic forest tree species adapted to warmer and drier climates or when considering new plantations at higher elevations.},

abstract = {Reliable models of fruit tree flowering phenology that are stable across different climate conditions and for a range of cultivars are required to better anticipate and adapt to anthropogenically induced climate change. Two phenology models, the commonly applied sequential model and the newly defined chill overlap model, were investigated to evaluate their ability to represent 'Cripps Pink' apple flowering phenology data from a wide range of Australian climates. This is the first study to directly compare the chill overlap and sequential phenology models and the first flowering phenology study of this spatial size for apple in the Southern Hemisphere. The sequential model did not adequately explain the variability in the dataset (RMSE 14.7 days) and was a worse approach than modelling to mean full bloom day-of-year (RMSE 9.6 days). The chill overlap model fitted with a chilling requirement of 34 chill portions was better able to represent the observations with RMSE of 6.9 and 5.8 days for parameterising and validating datasets, respectively. Based on the results of this study, further exploration and application of the chill overlap model is warranted, particularly in relation to climate impact assessments and for the development of adaptation strategies.},

abstract = {Tardive frosts, i.e. frost events occurring after grapevine budburst, are a significant risk for viticultural practices, which have recently caused substantial yield losses over different winegrowing regions of France, e.g. in 2016 and 2017. So far, it is unclear whether the frequency of late frosts events is destined to increase or decrease under future climatic conditions. Here, we assess the risk of tardive frosts for the French vineyards throughout the 21st century by analyzing temperature projections from eight climate models and their statistical regional downscaling. Our approach consists in comparing the statistical occurrences of the last frost (day of the year) and the characteristic budburst date for nine grapevine varieties as simulated by three different phenological models. Climate models qualitatively agree in projecting a gradual increase in temperature all over the France, which generally produces both an earlier characteristic last frost day and an earlier characteristic budburst date. However, the latter notably depends on the specific phenological model, implying a large uncertainty in assessing the risk exposure. Overall, we identified Alsace, Burgundy and Champagne as the most vulnerable regions, where the probability of tardive frost is projected to significantly increase throughout the 21st century for two out of three phenological models. The third phenological model produces opposite results, but the comparison between simulated budburst dates and observed records over the last 60 years suggests its lower reliability. Nevertheless, for a more trustworthy risk assessment, the validity of the budburst models should be accurately tested also for warmer climate conditions, in order to narrow down the associated large uncertainty.},

abstract = {This study seeks to highlight the range of chilling requirement values that can be obtained for one cherry cultivar (‘Lapins') across different Australian locations by using the same data but different approaches in calculating chilling requirement (CR). We seek to test the assumption that chill thresholds are fixed. The physiological and in-field implications for management are explored. All sites and years showed a steady increase in chill accumulation during the year. Bud burst in relation to accumulated chill portions (CP) was not consistent between sites or years, but all sites exhibited a sharp increase in bud burst after 40 chill portions (CP). Using a 50{\%} bud burst threshold performed statistically better than a 30{\%} bud burst threshold, and observed CR values performed slightly better than modelled CR values. The spatial analyses of safe winter chill for the range of CR determined in this study confirm the variability in values between the 30{\%} and 50{\%} bud burst approach. Imposing a fixed start date for chill accumulation excluded varying amounts of chill compared with using the self-regulating start time and increased the variation of CR values. The implications of using different methods to estimate CR, using projected estimates of chill accumulation under climate change, are provided. This study has e xposed the complexity in not only comparing CR values from previous studies, but the inherent confusion in the communication of such knowledge, especially with the additional consideration of a warming climate.},

Experimental and modeling approaches have sought to identify the mechanisms causing these shifts, as well as to make predictions regarding the consequences.

Here we investigate the change in the number of GSFDs at latitudes greater than 30° N using remotely-sensed and in situ phenological records and three minimum temperature (Tmin) data sets from 1982 to 2012. While decreased GSFDs are found in northern Siberia, the Tibetan Plateau, and northwestern North America (mainly in autumn), {\~{}}43{\%} of the hemisphere, especially in Europe, experienced a significant increase in GSFDs between 1982 and 2012 (mainly during spring).

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Modeling studies predict that global warming might severely affect bud dormancy release. However, growing empirical evidences suggest that long photoperiod might compensate for a lack of chilling temperature in photosensitive species. For now, attempts to integrate this effect into models remain limited. Here, we used French budburst phenological records for two main European temperate tree species, Fagus sylvatica (n = 136) and Quercus petraea (n = 276), to compare four phenological models accounting for a photoperiod effect, two of them proposing a new formalism of the effect of photoperiod, and three classical thermal models. We also investigated the effect of a realistic photoperiod cue on budburst dates in future climatic conditions. Consistently with the empirical literature, we find that models integrating a photoperiod cue were more relevant to simulate budburst dates for beech than for oak. However, contrary to the recently debated expectation that photoperiod might mitigate the trend towards earlier budburst date, we find that the compensatory effect of photoperiod on a lack of chilling maintains a trend towards earlier dates up to the end of the 2100. Our results also suggest that phenological rank changes between photosensitive and photo-insensitive species may be more pronounced at cold than warm trailing edge.},
